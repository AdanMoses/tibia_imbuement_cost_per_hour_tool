# Tibia Imbuement Cost Per Hour Tool

## Imbuement Tool for the MMO Tibia

This is a tool to find out the cost of the regular imbuements (strike, vampirism, void) per hour, price based on the price of gold tokens(price in k's with one decimal (xx.x)). It takes the price of each gold token as the first argument, and the total number of imbuements as the second argument. ie:

```bash
node imbuement_pph_calc.js 36 3
```

Where 36 is the 36k for each gold token, and 3 is the number of imbuements.
